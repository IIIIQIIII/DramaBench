I want him to kneel before my father's grave and admit his guilt!\n\nTwo BODYGUARDS drag WEN CHENG over, soaking wet and covered in mud, forcing him to kneel on the ground.\n\nSONG WAN\nWen Cheng, do you know? Your face used to be my favorite thing about you. But now, seeing your face makes me feel nothing but disgust! I hate myself for marrying you, for sponsoring you and making you famous! People like you should crawl in the gutter for the rest of your life and never rise again!\n\nWEN CHENG\n(weak)\nWanwan, Wanwan, it really wasn't me who betrayed Dad.\n\nSONG WAN\nBut my father is already dead!
