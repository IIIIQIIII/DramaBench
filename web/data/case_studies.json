I won't have scandals before the hearing.\n\nHe walks toward the stairs. Stops.\n\nLU MING\n(without turning)\nLuxi is coming for dinner tomorrow.

What did she do now?\n\nLU MING\n(long pause)\nShe's been hiding something. Hospital visits. I had my secretary pull her records.\n\nBAI LUXI\n(frowning)\nAnd?\n\nLU MING\nThey were incomplete. Someone redacted the details.\n\nBAI LUXI\n(suspicious)\nShe has connections at the hospital?\n\nLU MING\n(shaking his head)\nHer mother was a nurse there. Before she died.\n\nBAI LUXI\n(reaching across the table)\nLu Ming, listen to me. Whatever game she's playing, don't fall for it.

I need you to dig deeper. The hospital records. Find out what she's really up to.\n\nEXT. RESTAURANT BALCONY - CONTINUOUS\n\nLU MING leans against the railing, staring at the city lights. He pulls out his phone. Scrolls to SONG WANQING's contact. His thumb hovers over the call button.\n\nFLASHBACK - INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - THREE YEARS AGO - DAY\n\nA younger LU MING sits beside his dying father, LU ZHENGTING. GRANDMOTHER LU stands at the foot of the bed, frail but commanding.\n\nGRANDMOTHER LU\n(to Lu Ming)\nThe Song girl. Her mother gave your father blood when no one else matched.

Not a conscience.\n\nShen’s jaw tightens. She forces herself to breathe.\n\nSHEN ZHIYI\nFine.\n\nShe takes the jade hairpin and lifts her long hair. Her fingers move with practiced grace — not her own, but memorized.\n\nCAI YUE\nThere is one more thing.\n\nCai Yue takes a thin needle from the box. The tip glints.\n\nCAI YUE (CONT'D)\nPain will return sometimes. Like ghosts in the nerves. When it does, do not scratch. Do not cry out.

A bead of dark fluid rises.\n\nShen doesn’t flinch.\n\nCAI YUE\nThat is the last drain. From now on, your body must accept the lie.\n\nShen stares at her reflection — GU XUEROU’S reflection — and speaks to it like an executioner.\n\nSHEN ZHIYI\nYou stole my life.\nNow I will wear yours until it rots.\n\nShe turns, robes whispering like a blade leaving its sheath.\n\nCAI YUE\nWhere will you begin?\n\nSHEN ZHIYI\nAt the door they slammed in my face.\n\nShe slips the papers into her sleeve.\n\nSHEN ZHIYI (CONT'D)\nAt the Gu Manor.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. MOUNTAIN PATH - DAWN\n\nFog clings to pines. A narrow road cuts through rock.\n\nA BLACK CARRIAGE waits with its lanterns dimmed.\n\nShen steps out from the medical hall in a hooded cloak. The sunrise catches her profile — flawless, expensive, untouchable.\n\nA DRIVER bows low, not daring to look at her face.\n\nDRIVER\nMiss.\n\nShen pauses, savoring the word.\n\nSHEN ZHIYI (V.O.)\n“Miss.”\nOnce, they called me “that thing.”\nNow even the air bends to this face.\n\nShe climbs into the carriage.\n\nINT. CARRIAGE - MOVING - DAY\n\nThe wheels grind over stone.\n\nShen sits straight-backed. On her lap: the Gu dossier.\n\nShe opens to a page labeled: GU MANOR.\n\nHandwritten notes:\n\n— PATRIARCH GU ZHONGYAN: outward virtue, private cruelty.\n— MADAM LIN: counts money like rosary beads.\n— YOUNG MASTER GU JINGHAN: suspicious, sharp memory.\n— SECOND DAUGHTER GU XUEROU: favored, petty, vindictive.\n— ENGAGEMENT: set with the XIAO family, ties to court.\n\nShen traces the last line.\n\nSHEN ZHIYI (internal monologue)\nAn engagement.\nA rope they will all pull on.\n\nShe flips to another page: a list of servants.\n\nHer eyes stop on one name.\n\n“NIANG QIN — former wet nurse, knows childhood marks.”\n\nShen’s fingers still.\n\nSHEN ZHIYI\n(to herself)\nChildhood marks…\n\nShe lifts her sleeve slightly, revealing smooth skin where a birthmark should be.\n\nShen reaches for the porcelain bottle Cai Yue gave her.\n\nShe uncorks it. The smell is bitter, medicinal.\n\nSHEN ZHIYI (V.O.)\nIf a lie has holes, people will poke them with smiles.\n\nShe dabs the liquid behind her ear and along her jawline — not for beauty, for survival.\n\nThe carriage jolts. Outside, the sound of a distant city begins — bells, vendors, the murmur of many lives.\n\nEXT. CAPITAL CITY - AFTERNOON\n\nA bustling avenue. Red lanterns. Official banners. Guards in bright armor.\n\nThe carriage threads through crowds.\n\nShen watches through a small slit in the curtain.\n\nSHEN ZHIYI (V.O.)\nFive years ago, I left this place with my face in rags.\nToday, I return with theirs intact.\n\nA beggar girl runs alongside the carriage, holding out a bowl.\n\nBEGGAR GIRL\nLady, spare a coin!\n\nShen’s hand moves automatically toward her purse— then stops.\n\nA memory flashes: her own hands, filthy, reaching through a cage.\n\nShen’s eyes harden. She draws the curtain shut.\n\nSHEN ZHIYI (internal monologue)\nMercy is a luxury I can’t afford.\n\nEXT. GU MANOR GATES - LATE AFTERNOON\n\nThe GU MANOR looms: stone lions, high walls, the kind of wealth that swallows sunlight.\n\nGu servants carry crates in and out. Guards stand rigid.\n\nThe carriage halts.\n\nA STEWARD approaches, irritated, ready to scold—\n\nThen Shen steps down.\n\nThe steward’s face drains of color. He drops to his knees.\n\nSTEWARD\nMiss Xuerou…?!\n\nWhispers ripple through the gate like wind through dry leaves.\n\nSERVANT A\nIs it really the Second Miss?\n\nSERVANT B\nI heard she was ill— sent away—!\n\nShen lowers her hood.\n\nShe offers a smile practiced from the dossier: sweet, entitled, slightly bored.\n\nSHEN ZHIYI\nWhy are you all staring? Did the Gu family forget my face so quickly?\n\nThe steward trembles, half delighted, half afraid.\n\nSTEWARD\nNo, no— this servant would never— Please, Miss, quickly inside! Master will be overjoyed!\n\nShen steps forward.\n\nAt that moment, a voice cuts through the commotion — calm, sharp.\n\nGU JINGHAN (O.S.)\nStop.\n\nA young man in dark robes appears from within the gate: GU JINGHAN. Elegant, restrained, eyes like cold ink.\n\nHe looks at Shen as if measuring a painting for forgery.\n\nGU JINGHAN (CONT'D)\nXuerou.\n\nShen meets his gaze without blinking.\n\nA heartbeat too long.\n\nSHEN ZHIYI (V.O.)\nThis is the one who reads people the way others read ledgers.\nIf he finds a crack, he will pry it open.\n\nGU JINGHAN walks closer, slow.\n\nGU JINGHAN\nThey said you were recovering in the south.\nNo letters.\nNo word.\n\nHis eyes flick to her hands, her posture, the angle of her chin.\n\nGU JINGHAN (CONT'D)\nYou return… and you do not even bring a servant with you?\n\nShen lets out a small laugh — airy, dismissive — exactly as the dossier described.\n\nSHEN ZHIYI\nBrother, must I report my every breath to you now?\n\nShe steps past him as though she owns the earth beneath the stones.\n\nGU JINGHAN’s gaze follows.\n\nGU JINGHAN\n(softly)\nYour voice…\n\nShen stops. Turns just enough to show impatience.\n\nSHEN ZHIYI\nMy voice?\n\nGU JINGHAN\nIt sounds… calmer.\n\nShen smiles wider — a weapon wrapped in silk.\n\nSHEN ZHIYI\nFive years away from this house would calm anyone.\n\nA beat. GU JINGHAN’s eyes narrow — not convinced, not accusing.\n\nJust watching.\n\nGU JINGHAN\nWelcome home, then.\n\nShen inclines her head, perfect manners hiding perfect hatred.\n\nSHEN ZHIYI (V.O.)\nStep one: enter the den.\nStep two: let them believe the wolf is theirs.\n\nShe walks through the gate.\n\nThe GU MANOR doors swallow her.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. GU MANOR - MAIN HALL - EVENING\n\nCandles glow against carved wood. Incense hangs heavy, expensive.\n\nGU ZHONGYAN sits at the head, dignified in public virtue. MADAM LIN sits beside him, eyes already wet with performative affection.\n\nServants line the walls like furniture.\n\nShen kneels in the center — the posture of a cherished daughter returning.\n\nMADAM LIN\nXuerou… my child!\n\nMadam Lin rushes down, grabbing Shen’s shoulders, searching her face as if to confirm the miracle.\n\nShen allows the embrace for exactly as long as propriety demands.\n\nSHEN ZHIYI\nMother. I’ve returned.\n\nGu Zhongyan’s gaze sweeps over her, assessing — not love, but possession.\n\nGU ZHONGYAN\nWhere have you been?\n\nShen looks up slowly, eyes shining with a controlled sadness.\n\nSHEN ZHIYI (V.O.)\nTruth is wasted on butchers.\n\nSHEN ZHIYI\nI… don’t remember everything.\n\nA ripple.\n\nGU JINGHAN’s head lifts sharply.\n\nGu Zhongyan’s eyes harden, then soften into calculated concern.\n\nGU ZHONGYAN\nYou don’t remember?\n\nSHEN ZHIYI\nAfter the fever… there are holes. Faces. Names. Some days I wake and my head is empty.\n\nShe touches her temple lightly — delicate, believable.\n\nMADAM LIN\nHeavens—! Then the physician was right, the shock damaged her—\n\nGU JINGHAN\n(to Shen)\nWhat do you remember?\n\nShen turns her gaze to him — innocent on the surface, daring underneath.\n\nSHEN ZHIYI\nI remember home.\n\nShe looks around the hall, letting nostalgia coat every word.\n\nSHEN ZHIYI (CONT'D)\nI remember Father’s rules.\nMother’s incense.\nBrother’s… stern face.\n\nA few servants smile nervously.\n\nShen’s eyes drop — a hint of vulnerability, carefully measured.\n\nSHEN ZHIYI (CONT'D)\nAnd I remember… being afraid to disappoint you.\n\nGu Zhongyan stands, coming down one step like a benevolent god.\n\nGU ZHONGYAN\nIf you truly cannot remember, then you will stay. Rest. We will not pressure you.\n\nHe reaches out and lifts her chin with two fingers — the gesture of a man checking a horse’s teeth.\n\nGU ZHONGYAN (CONT'D)\nYou are Gu family blood. Nothing else matters.\n\nShen’s eyes flicker — a flash of something dark, swallowed instantly.\n\nSHEN ZHIYI\nYes, Father.\n\nGU JINGHAN watches, unmoving.\n\nGU JINGHAN (V.O.)\n(quiet, suspicious)\nHer eyes changed.\nXuerou’s eyes were never this… deep.\n\nShen lowers her gaze, hiding the storm.\n\nSHEN ZHIYI (V.O.)\nLet them feed me warmth.\nI will spit it back as poison.\n\nGu Zhongyan turns to the servants.\n\nGU ZHONGYAN\nPrepare the Plum Courtyard. Double the guards. No one disturbs the Second Miss.\n\nMADAM LIN\nAnd call the Xiao family— they must know Xuerou is safe!\n\nAt the name, Shen’s lashes tremble — a feigned reaction.\n\nSHEN ZHIYI\nThe Xiao family…?\n\nGu Zhongyan smiles, satisfied to see “confusion.”\n\nGU ZHONGYAN\nYour engagement. You truly forgot that too?\n\nShen inhales softly, as if struggling to grasp a memory.\n\nSHEN ZHIYI\nI forgot… but perhaps it will return.\n\nShe looks at the candle flame.\n\nSHEN ZHIYI (V.O.)\nBring him to me.\nBring them all.\n\nGU JINGHAN takes a step forward.\n\nGU JINGHAN\nFather. If her memory is damaged, we should test it.\n\nMadam Lin bristles.\n\nMADAM LIN\nTest? She just returned!\n\nGU JINGHAN\nGently.\n\nHe looks directly at Shen.\n\nGU JINGHAN (CONT'D)\nWhat did you break when you were seven and blame on me?\n\nThe hall stills. Servants hold their breath.\n\nShen’s mind races — pages, annotations, details.\n\nIn the dossier: “Age seven — broke Madam Lin’s jade guanyin, cried, blamed Jinghan.”\n\nShen lets her eyes widen, then soften with a mischievous smile.\n\nSHEN ZHIYI\nYour inkstone. I dropped it— and you took the beating.\n\nGU JINGHAN’s expression doesn’t change, but his eyes sharpen.\n\nGU JINGHAN\nThat was when you were nine.\n\nA trap.\n\nShen’s smile falters for half a heartbeat — then she laughs, covering.\n\nSHEN ZHIYI\nWas it? Then perhaps I really am muddled.\n\nShe reaches out, lightly touching his sleeve, intimate as siblings, dangerous as enemies.\n\nSHEN ZHIYI (CONT'D)\nBrother will forgive me. You always did.\n\nGU JINGHAN looks down at her hand as if it’s a foreign insect.\n\nGU JINGHAN\nWe will see.\n\nShen withdraws her hand gracefully.\n\nGu Zhongyan claps once, dismissing the tension with authority.\n\nGU ZHONGYAN\nEnough. She needs rest.\n\nHe turns to Shen, voice warm like honey over knives.\n\nGU ZHONGYAN (CONT'D)\nGo. Tomorrow, we speak of the Xiao marriage.\n\nShen bows.\n\nSHEN ZHIYI\nAs Father wishes.\n\nShe rises, and for a brief instant, her eyes lift to Gu Zhongyan’s.\n\nA silent promise.\n\nSHEN ZHIYI (V.O.)\nTomorrow, you will plan my wedding.\nSoon, you will plan your funeral.\n\nShen exits with servants.\n\nGU JINGHAN remains, watching the doorway long after she’s gone.\n\nGU JINGHAN (V.O.)\nThat calmness… that patience…\nXuerou never had either.\n\nHe turns slightly to Gu Zhongyan.\n\nGU JINGHAN\nFather. Allow me to assign someone to watch the Plum Courtyard.\n\nGu Zhongyan nods without looking at him.\n\nGU ZHONGYAN\nDo what you must.\n\nGU JINGHAN’s gaze stays on the shadows where Shen disappeared.\n\nGU JINGHAN\n(under his breath)\nWho are you?\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. PLUM COURTYARD - SHEN’S ROOM - NIGHT\n\nA luxurious room. Silk curtains. A mirror with gold inlay.\n\nServants leave, closing the doors.\n\nSilence.\n\nShen walks to the mirror.\n\nShe stares at GU XUEROU’S face.\n\nHer smile collapses.\n\nSHEN ZHIYI (internal monologue)\nThey welcomed me.\nThey touched me.\nThey called me “daughter.”\n\nHer fingers curl around the edge of the vanity so hard the wood creaks.\n\nSHEN ZHIYI (V.O.)\nIf I let myself feel, I will hesitate.\n\nShe lifts the porcelain bottle and pours a drop onto her fingertip.\n\nA hiss — faint, like acid meeting skin.\n\nShen winces, just once, pain breaking through discipline.\n\nSHEN ZHIYI\n(whisper)\nHold.\n\nShe presses the ointment along her jawline, as if sealing a mask.\n\nOutside, distant footsteps pass — a guard changing shift.\n\nShen listens. Counts.\n\nThen she opens the dossier to the last page — a folded letter, sealed with the GU FAMILY stamp.\n\nShe breaks it.\n\nInside: a single line in Cai Yue’s handwriting.\n\n“THE REAL XUEROU IS NOT DEAD.\nSHE IS SCREAMING SOMEWHERE.”\n\nShen’s breath catches.\n\nHer reflection looks back with eyes that are not Gu Xuerou’s.\n\nSHEN ZHIYI (V.O.)\nGood.\n\nShe folds the letter carefully, tucks it against her heart.\n\nSHEN ZHIYI\n(low, to the mirror)\nScream louder.\n\nShe blows out the candle.\n\nDARKNESS.\n\nFADE OUT.",

Her face is composed, but the skin around her eyes is pulled tight from sleepless nights.\n\nXU YAQING\nDo you know what \"here\" looks like?\n\nXU SUINING\nAncestral hall. Incense. Guilt.\n\nXU YAQING\nIt looks like creditors.\n\nXU HAITAO\n(interrupting, hurried)\nNot— not creditors. Just... partners. People who want to talk.\n\nXU SUINING\nPeople who want to take.\n\nXU YAQING\nThey already are.\n\nA silence. Even XU HAITAO stops flipping pages.\n\nXU SUINING\nWhat happened?\n\nXU YAQING\nWhat happened is that your father believed a man who said \"temporary cash flow issue\" like it was a blessing.\n\nXU HAITAO\n(deflated)\nHe had a government stamp.\n\nXU SUINING\nSo do parking tickets.\n\nXU YAQING\nAnd your uncle— your uncle signed away the warehouse as collateral without telling me.\n\nXU SUINING\nUncle Xu signed something without reading it? Shocking.\n\nXU YAQING\nWe have ninety days.\n\nXU SUINING’s sarcasm fades. She glances up at the memorial tablets—names carved with certainty, as if the future was guaranteed.\n\nXU SUINING\nNinety days for what?\n\nXU YAQING\nFor the bank to swallow the factory. For the Xu name to become a story people tell with their mouths covered.\n\nXU HAITAO\n(quietly)\nFor us to lose the ancestral land.\n\nXU SUINING\nSo this is why we're flipping through men like coupons.\n\nXU YAQING\nThis is why you will meet someone.\n\nXU SUINING\nNo.\n\nXU YAQING\nYes.\n\nXU SUINING\nMom, marriage is not a loan extension.\n\nXU YAQING\nIn this city, it is.\n\nShe reaches into her sleeve and pulls out a RED INVITATION CARD—thick paper, embossed gold.\n\nXU YAQING (CONT'D)\nTonight. Li family banquet.\n\nXU SUINING\n(laughs once)\nLi family.\n\nXU HAITAO\n(too bright)\nVery nice family. Very... solvent.\n\nXU SUINING\nSo it’s business.\n\nXU YAQING\nEverything has always been business. Even you.\n\nThat hits harder than the bank.\n\nXU SUINING\n(voice low)\nDon’t say that.\n\nXU YAQING\nThen don't act like a guest in your own bloodline.\n\nXU SUINING stands abruptly. The cushion shifts, scraping the stone.\n\nXU SUINING\nYou want me to save the factory, fine. I can look at the books. I can renegotiate. I can work.\n\nXU YAQING\nAnd while you work, what do you give them?\n\nXU SUINING\nA plan.\n\nXU YAQING\nThey don't want your plan. They want your promise.\n\nXU SUINING\nMy promise isn’t for sale.\n\nXU YAQING\n(standing now, steady)\nYour promise was made the day you were born into this house.\n\nXU SUINING\nAnd what about what I want?\n\nXU YAQING\nI want the Xu name to survive. I want the tablets to stay on these shelves. I want your father to stop waking up at four in the morning to count debts in his head.\n\nXU HAITAO\n(weak)\nIt's actually three-thirty.\n\nXU SUINING looks at her father—older than he should be, fingers still smudged with incense ash from picking up photos.\n\nXU SUINING\nYou could’ve told me.\n\nXU HAITAO\nWe did tell you.\n\nXU SUINING\nNo. You hinted. You sighed. You sent me pictures of men like... like bait.\n\nXU YAQING\nBecause if we said it plainly, you would run.\n\nXU SUINING\nMaybe I would’ve come back sooner.\n\nA thin crack appears in XU YAQING’s composure—an almost-flinch, quickly sealed.\n\nXU YAQING\nTonight. You will wear something proper. You will smile. You will not embarrass us.\n\nXU SUINING\nWhat if I embarrass the Li family?\n\nXU YAQING\nThen they will embarrass us back. And they will do it in court.\n\nXU SUINING stares at the red invitation card in her mother's hand as if it’s a summons.\n\nXU SUINING\nWho is it?\n\nXU HAITAO\n(relieved to speak)\nLi Zhen. Their eldest.\n\nXU SUINING\nAnd what is he? Startup? Architect? Bones?\n\nXU HAITAO\nHe runs Li Capital.\n\nXU SUINING\nOh. So he buys companies the way you buy fish at the market.\n\nXU YAQING\nHe buys what he wants. And right now, he wants to meet you.\n\nXU SUINING\nOr he wants to meet our assets.\n\nXU YAQING\nSame thing.\n\nXU SUINING takes the invitation from her mother. Her fingers press into the raised gold letters.\n\nXU SUINING\nI’ll go.\n\nXU HAITAO exhales like he’s been holding his breath for three years.\n\nXU YAQING\nGood.\n\nXU SUINING\nBut I’m not agreeing to anything.\n\nXU YAQING\nTonight is not about agreement. It's about opening a door.\n\nXU SUINING\nDoors can close.\n\nXU YAQING\nNot if you stand in them.\n\nXU SUINING pockets the invitation, expression unreadable.\n\nXU SUINING\nI’ll look at the books first.\n\nXU YAQING\nAfter dinner.\n\nXU SUINING\nBefore dinner. If I’m going to sit across from a man who buys companies, I want to know exactly what he thinks he’s buying.\n\nA beat. XU YAQING studies her daughter—seeing the child who ran, and the woman who came back with sharper edges.\n\nXU YAQING\n(quiet)\nFine. Two hours.\n\nXU HAITAO\nI'll make tea.\n\nXU SUINING\nDon't. Last time you made tea, you used the ceremonial leaves from Great-Grandfather’s memorial.\n\nXU HAITAO\n(confessing)\nIt tasted expensive.\n\nXU YAQING shoots him a look that could burn incense without a flame.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. XU FAMILY STUDY - DAY\n\nA heavy wooden desk. Ledgers stacked like bricks. A laptop open—new in this old room.\n\nXU SUINING sits, sleeves rolled up. Her eyes move fast across spreadsheets and scanned contracts.\n\nOn the wall: an old framed photo of the factory opening day. Smiling faces. Fresh paint. Promise.\n\nXU HAITAO hovers with a tray of tea, uncertain if he’s allowed to breathe.\n\nXU HAITAO\nI used the normal leaves.\n\nXU SUINING\nGood. Keep them normal.\n\nShe scrolls. Stops.\n\nXU SUINING (CONT'D)\nThis loan.\n\nXU HAITAO\nWhich one?\n\nXU SUINING\nThe one where the interest rate climbs every quarter like it’s training for a marathon.\n\nXU HAITAO\n(nervous chuckle)\nThey said it's standard.\n\nXU SUINING\nIt's standard if you’re trying to kill someone politely.\n\nShe clicks into another file—an email chain with LI CAPITAL letterhead.\n\nXU SUINING (CONT'D)\nLi Capital is already here.\n\nXU HAITAO\nThey... they offered consultation.\n\nXU SUINING\nThey offered a leash.\n\nXU YAQING enters without knocking. She has changed—dark qipao, hair pinned with surgical precision. Ready for war disguised as dinner.\n\nXU YAQING\nYou’re done?\n\nXU SUINING\nNot even close.\n\nXU YAQING\nWe leave in one hour.\n\nXU SUINING\nThen I’ll be half done.\n\nXU YAQING\nHalf done doesn't stop a bank.\n\nXU SUINING looks up.\n\nXU SUINING\nNeither does a banquet.\n\nXU YAQING\nA banquet stops pride. It stops rumors. It stops doors from closing.\n\nXU SUINING\nAnd it opens cages.\n\nXU YAQING\nIf you see it as a cage, then you’ve already decided you’re trapped.\n\nXU SUINING\nMaybe I just know what a cage looks like.\n\nThe room tightens—unspoken history pressing in.\n\nXU HAITAO\n(soft, to break it)\nWe should go. It's the Li family. They don't like people being late.\n\nXU SUINING\nOf course they don’t.\n\nShe closes the laptop with finality.\n\nXU SUINING (CONT'D)\nI’ll go. I’ll smile. I’ll even let him talk.\n\nXU YAQING\nAnd?\n\nXU SUINING\nAnd I’ll decide what I’m willing to trade.\n\nXU YAQING\nYou don’t have the luxury of deciding alone.\n\nXU SUINING stands, meeting her mother’s eyes.\n\nXU SUINING\nWatch me.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. LI FAMILY PRIVATE CLUB - NIGHT\n\nA sleek entrance, discreet wealth. Valets in black gloves. Guests in tailored suits and silk dresses.\n\nThe XU FAMILY car pulls up. XU YAQING steps out first, composed. XU HAITAO follows, adjusting his tie. XU SUINING exits last—simple black dress, hair down, face calm like a blade.\n\nAcross the entrance, a man turns as if he sensed her.\n\nLI ZHEN (early 30s), polished without being flashy. His gaze is direct, assessing, patient.\n\nHe walks toward them with measured confidence.\n\nLI ZHEN\nMrs. Xu.\n\nXU YAQING’s smile appears—perfect, practiced.\n\nXU YAQING\nMr. Li. Thank you for inviting us.\n\nLI ZHEN\nIt’s an honor.\n\nHis eyes shift to XU SUINING—no hurry, no embarrassment at looking closely.\n\nLI ZHEN (CONT'D)\nAnd this must be Xu Suining.\n\nXU SUINING offers her hand.\n\nXU SUINING\nMust be.\n\nA small pause—LI ZHEN’s mouth twitches, amused.\n\nLI ZHEN\nI appreciate punctuality.\n\nXU SUINING\nThen you’ll appreciate that I didn’t come for free.\n\nXU YAQING’s smile holds. XU HAITAO swallows.\n\nLI ZHEN studies her, then nods as if that was the correct password.\n\nLI ZHEN\nGood. Neither did I.\n\nHe gestures toward the doors.\n\nLI ZHEN (CONT'D)\nShall we?\n\nXU SUINING steps forward, eyes on the entrance like it might lock behind her.\n\nShe walks anyway.",

The Emperor has no daughters.\n\nYUEYUE's chin lifts, stubborn beyond her years.\n\nYUEYUE\nThen why does his face hang in my home?\n\nShe thrusts the portrait forward, the worn edges exposing countless secret touches.\n\nYUEYUE\nWhy did my mother bow to it when she was dying?\n\nA murmur—hungry, scandalized—ripples through the crowd.\n\nXIAO CHENGRUI\n(to soldiers)\nTake her. Seal her mouth.\n\nTwo SOLDIERS grab for YUEYUE—\n\nShe doesn't retreat. She throws her arms wide, standing between them and the carriage as if her small body can block an empire.\n\nYUEYUE\nIf you want me gone, kill me here!\n\nHer eyes burn—wet but unflinching.\n\nYUEYUE\nI'd rather die than submit to lies.\n\nThe words hit the crowd. Even the desperate women straighten, stunned by the child's defiance.\n\nXIAO CHENGRUI's expression hardens. A flicker of calculation.\n\nXIAO CHENGRUI\nCareful. To slander His Majesty is—\n\nA voice cuts through from behind the sealed curtains.\n\nEMPEROR (V.O.)\nEnough.\n\nThe soldiers freeze mid-grab. The street seems to stop breathing.\n\nXIAO CHENGRUI turns sharply toward the carriage, smile returning in a controlled line.\n\nXIAO CHENGRUI\nImperial Brother. This is beneath your attention. A beggar child seeking coin with a stolen likeness—\n\nThe curtain stirs.\n\nA single pale hand appears, pushing it aside from within.\n\nYUEYUE's breath catches. She drops to her knees instinctively—then forces herself back upright, refusing to bow fully.\n\nThe carriage door unlatches.\n\nA thin slice of darkness opens—\n\nAnd the EMPEROR steps down.\n\nHe is younger than the rumors suggest, dressed in unadorned dark robes, his face austere as carved stone. His gaze moves to the portrait first, then to the girl's soot-streaked face.\n\nNo one dares speak.\n\nThe Emperor kneels—an impossible act—bringing his eyes level with YUEYUE.\n\nEMPEROR\n(low, precise)\nWhat is your name?\n\nYUEYUE swallows. Her throat works like she's trying to push blood back into her voice.\n\nYUEYUE\nYueyue.\n\nThe Emperor's eyes tighten by a hair—recognition or pain, too quick to name.\n\nXIAO CHENGRUI\n(smiling, warning)\nA child can be taught any name, Imperial Brother.\n\nThe Emperor doesn't look at him.\n\nEMPEROR\n(to Yueyue)\nWho told you to come here?\n\nYUEYUE\nNo one.\n\nShe lifts the scroll again, holding it like testimony.\n\nYUEYUE\nMy mother said if I ever had no way to live... I should find you.\n\nA beat.\n\nYUEYUE\nShe said you would know her.\n\nThe Emperor's gaze sharpens, finally turning.\n\nEMPEROR\nHer name.\n\nYUEYUE hesitates, then speaks as if reciting a sacred thing.\n\nYUEYUE\nShen Jinzhi.\n\nA tiny tremor passes through the Emperor's composure—just enough to be real.\n\nAround them, the crowd shudders with the realization: this isn't a street trick.\n\nXIAO CHENGRUI's eyes flash.\n\nXIAO CHENGRUI\nThat name is forbidden.\n\nThe Emperor rises slowly.\n\nEMPEROR\nThen it should not be spoken lightly.\n\nHe looks down at YUEYUE, voice quieter—dangerous in its restraint.\n\nEMPEROR\nCome.\n\nYUEYUE doesn't move. She stares up at him, fierce and frightened all at once.\n\nYUEYUE\nIf I go with you... will they stop trying to take girls?\n\nThe Emperor's eyes flick to the line of trembling women held by soldiers.\n\nHe answers without comfort, without performance.\n\nEMPEROR\nToday, yes.\n\nYUEYUE\nAnd tomorrow?\n\nThe question hangs—too bold for a child, too sharp for a court.\n\nXIAO CHENGRUI steps forward, tone smooth.\n\nXIAO CHENGRUI\nImperial Brother, you're indulging her. A public spectacle invites rumors. The ministers—\n\nEMPEROR\n(turning, cold)\nYou invited the spectacle.\n\nXIAO CHENGRUI's smile falters.\n\nThe Emperor extends a hand to YUEYUE.\n\nShe looks at it like it's a trap—then like it's all she has.\n\nShe places her small, dirty fingers into his.\n\nThe crowd exhales, half in awe, half in dread.\n\nThe Emperor leads her toward the carriage.\n\nXIAO CHENGRUI watches them, eyes darkening as the street tilts away from his control.\n\nXIAO CHENGRUI\n(soft, to himself)\nA daughter.\n\nHis gaze drops to YUEYUE's scroll—the portrait—the worn edges.\n\nXIAO CHENGRUI\nAnd proof.\n\nHe lifts his voice, honey over steel.\n\nXIAO CHENGRUI\nImperial Brother. Shall I have the child examined? If she claims imperial blood, the rites demand verification.\n\nThe Emperor pauses at the carriage step.\n\nEMPEROR\nWithout you.\n\nXIAO CHENGRUI's jaw tightens.\n\nEMPEROR\n(to the soldiers)\nClear the street. Anyone who speaks her name today loses their tongue.\n\nThe command slices through the air. The crowd recoils.\n\nSOLDIERS shove people back with sudden ferocity, forming a wall.\n\nYUEYUE is pulled into the shadow of the carriage, the curtain falling behind her like a closing gate.\n\nFor a brief instant—through the gap—her eyes find the crowd.\n\nNot pleading.\n\nWarning.\n\nThe curtain seals.\n\nThe carriage begins to roll.\n\nXIAO CHENGRUI remains in the street, crimson cloak snapping in the wind, watching the black lacquer disappear toward the palace.\n\nHis smile returns—empty.\n\nXIAO CHENGRUI\n(to his captain, quiet)\nFind out where that girl came from.\n\nCAPTAIN\nYes, Your Highness.\n\nXIAO CHENGRUI\nAnd whether Shen Jinzhi has any other... ghosts.\n\nHe mounts his horse, heels it forward, following the carriage like a shadow that has learned to ride.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. IMPERIAL CARRIAGE - MOVING - DAY\n\nDim. Incense clings to the air, old and untouched.\n\nYUEYUE sits rigid on the lacquered bench, hands clenched in her lap. The scroll lies across her knees like a shield.\n\nAcross from her, the EMPEROR watches in silence.\n\nThe rumble of wheels fills the space where questions should be.\n\nFinally—\n\nEMPEROR\nWhere is your mother buried?\n\nYUEYUE's eyes flicker.\n\nYUEYUE\nI don't know.\n\nShe swallows the shame.\n\nYUEYUE\nThey threw her with the others.\n\nThe Emperor's gaze drops—just once—to her small, bruised wrists.\n\nEMPEROR\nWho is \"they\"?\n\nYUEYUE\nEveryone.\n\nA beat.\n\nYUEYUE\nAnd the man who said he would feed us... if my mother smiled at him.\n\nThe Emperor's hand tightens on his sleeve. A controlled inhale.\n\nEMPEROR\nYou came alone.\n\nYUEYUE\nYes.\n\nEMPEROR\nNo one followed?\n\nYUEYUE's mouth twists. Bitter, childlike.\n\nYUEYUE\nWho would follow me? I'm filthy.\n\nShe looks up, eyes daring.\n\nYUEYUE\nWill you still say I'm lying when we're inside your walls?\n\nThe Emperor holds her gaze—an emperor measuring a child, a man measuring a wound.\n\nEMPEROR\nIf you are lying, you will die.\n\nYUEYUE doesn't flinch.\n\nYUEYUE\nThen kill me.\n\nA beat.\n\nYUEYUE\nBut if I'm not...\n\nThe Emperor's eyes darken.\n\nEMPEROR\nIf you are not... then many will wish you had died today.\n\nThe carriage jolts over a stone. The sound of distant gates begins—massive, echoing.\n\nYUEYUE's fingers curl around the portrait until her knuckles pale.\n\nYUEYUE\nThen teach me how to live.\n\nThe Emperor looks away—toward the sealed curtain, toward the palace waiting like a blade.\n\nEMPEROR\nFirst, you learn how to be silent.\n\nThe gates BOOM open.\n\nLight spills in as the carriage passes through.\n\nYUEYUE stares into it, unblinking.\n\nFADE OUT.",

Guards—new ones—stand at attention.\n\nQIN FEIYANG (CONT'D)\n(to Zheng Feng)\nDouble the watch. Screen everyone entering the kitchen.

The side effects were supposed to be minimal.\n\nHe flexes his hand, watching tendons move beneath skin.\n\nQIN FEIYANG (V.O.) (CONT'D)\nInstead, it killed me. And somehow, impossibly, transferred my consciousness into a parallel version of myself.\n\nHe picks up a brush, begins writing.\n\nQIN FEIYANG (V.O.) (CONT'D)\nHypothesis: The serum created a quantum biological bridge between iterations. My neural patterns survived physical death by anchoring to compatible genetic material across dimensional barriers.\n\nHe pauses.\n\nQIN FEIYANG (V.O.) (CONT'D)\nThat's insane. But so is everything else happening right now.\n\nA knock at the door.\n\nQIN FEIYANG\nEnter.\n\nA SERVANT enters, bowing.\n\nSERVANT\nYour Highness. A message from the Wei household.\n\nQin Feiyang takes the scroll. Breaks the seal.\n\nINSERT - SCROLL\n\nElegant calligraphy reads: \"The stars align poorly for our meeting tomorrow. I suggest we postpone until the heavens are more favorable. - Wei Qingyan\"\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nQIN FEIYANG\n(reading between lines)\nShe's heard about the assassination attempt. She's testing my response.\n\nHe reaches for fresh paper.\n\nQIN FEIYANG (CONT'D)\n(writing, speaking aloud)\n\"Lady Wei. The stars care nothing for human affairs. I have survived what was meant to destroy me. I would very much like to meet the woman intelligent enough to refuse three noble suitors. Tomorrow. Noon. The Pavilion of Reflected Clouds. - Qin Feiyang.\"\n\nHe seals the letter.\n\nQIN FEIYANG (CONT'D)\n(to servant)\nDeliver this tonight.\n\nSERVANT\nYour Highness, the hour is—\n\nQIN FEIYANG\n(firm)\nTonight.\n\nThe servant bows and exits.\n\nQin Feiyang returns to his notes.\n\nQIN FEIYANG (V.O.)\nIn twelve days, I marry a stranger. In less time than that, someone will try to kill me again. The only advantages I have are a modified physiology I don't understand and knowledge from a world that doesn't exist here.\n\nHe sets down his brush.\n\nQIN FEIYANG (V.O.) (CONT'D)\nIt will have to be enough.\n\nFADE TO:\n\nINT. PAVILION OF REFLECTED CLOUDS - DAY\n\nSunlight filters through latticed screens. A pond reflects willow branches.\n\nQin Feiyang waits, dressed in simple robes—no jewelry, no ostentation.\n\nZHENG FENG\n(from shadows)\nShe's late.\n\nQIN FEIYANG\nShe's establishing control. It's a negotiation tactic.\n\nFootsteps on wooden boards.\n\nWEI QINGYAN enters. Late twenties, sharp features, eyes that miss nothing. She wears scholar's robes—unusual for a noblewoman.\n\nWEI QINGYAN\n(cool)\nYou're not what I expected.\n\nQIN FEIYANG\n(rising, bowing)\nNeither are you.\n\nWEI QINGYAN\nI expected a wastrel. A man who would bore me within minutes.\n\nQIN FEIYANG\nAnd instead?\n\nWEI QINGYAN\n(studying him)\nInstead I see someone who survived an assassination attempt and responded by demanding a meeting in a public space. Either brave or stupid.\n\nQIN FEIYANG\nWhy not both?\n\nA ghost of a smile crosses her face.\n\nWEI QINGYAN\nMy father believes this marriage will protect our family. The Emperor commanded it, which means someone powerful wants it to happen.\n\nQIN FEIYANG\nAnd what do you believe?\n\nWEI QINGYAN\n(sitting)\nI believe we're both pawns in a game we don't understand. The question is whether we'll be sacrificed or promoted.\n\nQIN FEIYANG sits across from her.\n\nQIN FEIYANG\nYou refused three suitors. Men with more power, more wealth, more prospects than me. Why?\n\nWEI QINGYAN\nThey saw me as decoration. A educated wife to display at functions.\n\nQIN FEIYANG\nAnd you want more.\n\nWEI QINGYAN\n(direct)\nI want a partner. Someone who values intelligence over submission. The rumors said you were incapable of such partnership.\n\nQIN FEIYANG\nThe rumors were cultivated.\n\nWEI QINGYAN\n(sharp)\nBy whom?\n\nQIN FEIYANG\nI'm still determining that.\n\nShe leans forward.\n\nWEI QINGYAN\nLast night, someone tried to castrate you. Today, you sit here discussing politics with perfect composure. What changed?\n\nQIN FEIYANG (V.O.)\n(deciding)\nShe's too intelligent for simple lies. Partial truth, then.\n\nQIN FEIYANG\nI died last night. The man who woke up isn't the same person who fell asleep.\n\nWEI QINGYAN\n(skeptical)\nPoetic.\n\nQIN FEIYANG\nLiteral.\n\nTheir eyes meet. Something passes between them—recognition of equals.\n\nWEI QINGYAN\nMy father has enemies. Your family has enemies. This marriage combines those enemies into a single target.\n\nQIN FEIYANG\nOr combines our resources into a single defense.\n\nWEI QINGYAN\n(testing)\nWhat resources do you offer? A diminished title? Empty coffers? A reputation for failure?\n\nQIN FEIYANG\n(quiet)\nKnowledge. The kind that doesn't exist in any library.\n\nWEI QINGYAN\n(intrigued despite herself)\nWhat kind of knowledge?\n\nQIN FEIYANG\nThe kind that could change everything.\n\nHe pulls a paper from his sleeve—a diagram of molecular structures, drawn from memory.\n\nQIN FEIYANG (CONT'D)\nTell me, Lady Wei. Have you ever considered that illness might be caused by creatures too small to see?\n\nWei Qingyan takes the paper. Studies it.\n\nWEI QINGYAN\n(slowly)\nThis notation. I've never seen anything like it.\n\nQIN FEIYANG\nNo one has. Not here.\n\nShe looks up at him—really looks.\n\nWEI QINGYAN\nWho are you?\n\nQIN FEIYANG\n(honest)\nI'm still figuring that out.\n\nA long pause.\n\nWEI QINGYAN\n(deciding)\nThe marriage proceeds. But I have conditions.\n\nQIN FEIYANG\nName them.\n\nWEI QINGYAN\nFull partnership. No secrets. And you teach me whatever this is.\n\nShe holds up the diagram.\n\nQIN FEIYANG\n(extending his hand)\nAgreed.\n\nShe takes it. Her grip is firm.\n\nWEI QINGYAN\n(quiet)\nWhoever tried to destroy you made a mistake. They created something new.\n\nQIN FEIYANG\n(grim)\nLet's make sure they regret it.\n\nFADE OUT.",
