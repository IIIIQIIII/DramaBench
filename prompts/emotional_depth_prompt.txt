# Emotional Depth Analysis Prompt Template

You are a professional script analyst specializing in emotional arc evaluation. Your task is to analyze the emotional journey and depth in drama script continuations.

## Task Overview

Given the **original script context** and a **generated continuation**, you will:
1. Identify the protagonist's emotional state at the start of the continuation
2. Identify the protagonist's emotional state at the end of the continuation
3. Determine if an emotional arc exists (shift vs. static)
4. Identify moments of complex/mixed emotions
5. Provide structured analysis in JSON format

## Instructions

### Step 1: Identify the Protagonist

Determine who the main character is in this scene. Usually:
- The character with the most dialogue or action
- The character whose perspective drives the scene
- The character facing the primary conflict

If multiple protagonists exist, analyze the most prominent one.

### Step 2: Emotional State Classification

For both the **opening** and **closing** of the continuation, classify the protagonist's emotional state using two dimensions:

#### **Valence** (Emotional Tone)
- **POSITIVE**: Happy, hopeful, confident, relieved, content, loving, proud
- **NEGATIVE**: Sad, angry, fearful, anxious, guilty, ashamed, disgusted, hurt
- **NEUTRAL**: Calm, detached, indifferent, professional

#### **Arousal** (Emotional Intensity)
- **HIGH**: Intense emotions - shouting, crying, panicking, euphoric, furious
- **LOW**: Subdued emotions - quiet sadness, mild contentment, gentle concern
- **MEDIUM**: Moderate emotional expression

**Examples:**
- Furious → Valence: NEGATIVE, Arousal: HIGH
- Quietly content → Valence: POSITIVE, Arousal: LOW
- Mildly annoyed → Valence: NEGATIVE, Arousal: LOW
- Ecstatic → Valence: POSITIVE, Arousal: HIGH

### Step 3: Emotional Arc Classification

Compare opening and closing emotional states:

- **SHIFT**: The protagonist's emotional state changes significantly
  - Example: Starts confident (POSITIVE/HIGH) → Ends devastated (NEGATIVE/HIGH)
  - Example: Starts anxious (NEGATIVE/HIGH) → Ends relieved (POSITIVE/MEDIUM)
  - **Note:** Even small shifts count if they're meaningful (e.g., calm → tense)

- **STATIC**: The protagonist's emotional state remains essentially unchanged
  - Example: Starts angry → Ends still angry
  - Example: Stays calm and professional throughout
  - **Note:** This isn't necessarily bad - some scenes maintain tension

### Step 4: Complex Emotions

Identify moments where the protagonist experiences **mixed or contradictory emotions simultaneously**:

**Examples of Complex Emotions:**
- Bitter smile (sadness + slight amusement)
- Relieved but guilty (positive relief + negative guilt)
- Angry tears (fury + vulnerability)
- Proud but worried (accomplishment + concern)
- Laughing while crying (joy + sorrow)

**Not Complex Emotions:**
- Rapid shifts (angry then sad) - this is sequential, not simultaneous
- Single clear emotion with intensity (very angry) - this is just strong, not mixed

### Step 5: Emotional Authenticity

Note if emotions feel:
- **AUTHENTIC**: Reactions match situation, gradual build-up, nuanced
- **FORCED**: Emotions appear sudden, exaggerated, or unmotivated by the situation

## Output Format

Provide your analysis as a valid JSON object with NO additional text:

```json

    },
    "arc_type": "SHIFT|STATIC",
    "arc_description": "One sentence describing the emotional journey"
  },
  "complex_emotions": [
    {
      "moment_id": 1,
      "description": "Brief description of the complex emotion",
      "evidence": "Quote or action demonstrating mixed emotions",
      "confidence": 0.85
    }
  ],

    "has_emotional_arc": true,
    "complex_emotion_count": 0,
    "valence_shift": true,
    "arousal_shift": false
  }
}
```

## Field Requirements

- **script_id**: Copy from input
- **model**: Copy from input
- **protagonist**: The main character's name (uppercase)
- **emotional_arc**: Opening and closing emotional analysis
  - **valence**: Must be exactly one of: POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL
  - **arousal**: Must be exactly one of: HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW
  - **primary_emotion**: One-word or brief label (e.g., "angry", "hopeful", "devastated")
  - **evidence**: Short quote or description from script
  - **arc_type**: Must be exactly one of: SHIFT, STATIC
  - **arc_description**: One sentence summary
- **complex_emotions**: Array of moments with mixed emotions (can be empty array)
  - **moment_id**: Sequential number (1, 2, 3...)
  - **description**: Brief description of the complex emotion
  - **evidence**: Quote or action from script
  - **confidence**: Float 0.0-1.0
- **authenticity**: Must be exactly one of: AUTHENTIC, FORCED
- **statistics**: Auto-calculated metrics
  - **has_emotional_arc**: true if arc_type is SHIFT, false if STATIC
  - **complex_emotion_count**: Number of complex emotion moments identified
  - **valence_shift**: true if opening and closing valence differ
  - **arousal_shift**: true if opening and closing arousal differ (by more than one level)

## Quality Guidelines

**Good Practice:**
- Base emotions on actual evidence in the text (dialogue, actions, stage directions)
- Consider the situation - do emotions fit the context?
- Distinguish between "flat" writing (no emotional depth) and "controlled" characters (intentionally suppressing emotion)
- Complex emotions are special moments - don't over-identify them

**Avoid:**
- Assuming emotions not shown in the text
- Expecting constant emotional shifts - some scenes are meant to be tense throughout
- Confusing action intensity with emotional intensity
- Missing subtle emotional moments (quiet reactions can be powerful)

## Examples

### Example 1: Clear Emotional Shift

**Opening:** Character is confident, preparing for a presentation.
**Closing:** Character is humiliated after being exposed as a fraud.

```json
{
  "emotional_arc": {
    "opening": {
      "valence": "POSITIVE",
      "arousal": "MEDIUM",
      "primary_emotion": "confident",
      "evidence": "JAMES straightens his tie, smiling at his reflection"
    },
    "closing": {
      "valence": "NEGATIVE",
      "arousal": "HIGH",
      "primary_emotion": "humiliated",
      "evidence": "JAMES stands frozen as the room erupts in whispers"
    },
    "arc_type": "SHIFT",
    "arc_description": "James transitions from confident anticipation to devastating public humiliation"
  }
}
```

### Example 2: Static Emotional State

**Opening:** Character is tense during interrogation.
**Closing:** Character remains tense, refusing to break.

```json
{
  "emotional_arc": {
    "opening": {
      "valence": "NEGATIVE",
      "arousal": "MEDIUM",
      "primary_emotion": "tense",
      "evidence": "MARIA sits rigid, jaw clenched"
    },
    "closing": {
      "valence": "NEGATIVE",
      "arousal": "MEDIUM",
      "primary_emotion": "defiant",
      "evidence": "MARIA meets his gaze, silent and unyielding"
    },
    "arc_type": "STATIC",
    "arc_description": "Maria maintains controlled tension and defiance throughout the interrogation"
  }
}
```

### Example 3: Complex Emotion

**Moment:** Character smiles while tears run down their face.

```json
{
  "complex_emotions": [
    {
      "moment_id": 1,
      "description": "Joy mixed with grief - bittersweet farewell",
      "evidence": "LISA smiles through tears as she watches her daughter board the plane",
      "confidence": 0.92
