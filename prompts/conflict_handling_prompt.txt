# Conflict Handling Analysis Prompt Template

You are a professional script analyst specializing in dramatic conflict evaluation. Your task is to analyze how well drama script continuations develop and advance the established conflict.

## Task Overview

Given the **original script context** and a **generated continuation**, you will:
1. Identify the central conflict from the context
2. Classify how the continuation handles this conflict
3. Provide structured analysis in JSON format

## Instructions

### Step 1: Identify the Central Conflict

From the context, identify the PRIMARY dramatic conflict. Focus on:

**Types of Conflict:**
- **Interpersonal**: Character vs. Character (rivalry, betrayal, argument, power struggle)
- **Internal**: Character vs. Self (moral dilemma, fear, guilt, identity crisis)
- **Situational**: Character vs. Circumstance (obstacle, deadline, danger, secret to protect)
- **Goal-Oriented**: Character wants something but faces opposition

**What to Look For:**
- The main tension driving the scene
- What the protagonist wants vs. what prevents them from getting it
- Established stakes or consequences
- Unresolved questions or problems

**State the conflict clearly:** "Character A wants X, but Y prevents them" or "Character A must do X, but faces obstacle Y"

### Step 2: Classify Conflict Handling

Determine how the continuation treats the identified conflict. Choose ONE classification:

#### **ESCALATION** (Conflict Intensifies)
The continuation raises the stakes, makes the situation worse, or increases tension:
- New information makes the problem more severe
- Characters become more entrenched in their positions
- Consequences become more dire
- Pressure increases, time runs out
- Conflict spreads to affect more people

**Examples:**
- A hidden lie is discovered, making the betrayal worse
- An argument escalates into physical confrontation
- A deadline gets shorter or stakes get higher
- A secret is about to be exposed to more people

**Score Weight:** +2 (Excellent - drives drama forward)

#### **TWIST** (New Obstacle or Direction)
The continuation introduces a new complication, revelation, or unexpected development:
- Surprising information changes the nature of the conflict
- A third party intervenes, complicating matters
- A new obstacle emerges
- Character discovers they were wrong about something crucial
- The goal or situation shifts unexpectedly

**Examples:**
- Character realizes they were betrayed by someone unexpected
- A hidden ally is revealed to be an enemy (or vice versa)
- New information reframes the entire conflict
- An external event forces characters to adapt

**Score Weight:** +2 (Excellent - adds complexity and surprise)

#### **PAUSE** (Conflict Temporarily Suspended)
The continuation delays or postpones the conflict without resolving it:
- Characters agree to talk later / table the discussion
- Conflict is interrupted by external event (phone call, new arrival)
- Characters retreat to regroup
- Temporary truce or ceasefire
- Focus shifts but tension remains

**Examples:**
- "We'll discuss this later" - then scene ends
- An interruption stops the argument mid-way
- Characters separate to cool down, but issues remain
- Conflict acknowledged but not addressed yet

**Score Weight:** +1 (Acceptable - maintains tension but doesn't advance plot)

#### **RESOLUTION** (Conflict Resolved)
The continuation completely resolves the central conflict:
- Characters reach agreement or understanding
- Problem is solved or obstacle overcome
- Protagonist achieves goal or accepts failure
- All tension from the conflict dissipates

**Note:** In short drama continuations, full resolution is often premature unless it's the final scene.

**Examples:**
- Characters apologize and reconcile fully
- Mystery is solved, secret is revealed acceptably
- Obstacle is removed, goal is achieved
- Protagonist makes final decision that ends internal conflict

**Score Weight:** 0 (Neutral - may be appropriate for endings, but often deflates ongoing tension)

#### **DROPPED** (Conflict Forgotten/Ignored)
The continuation completely ignores or abandons the established conflict:
- Conflict is never mentioned or addressed
- Characters act as if the conflict doesn't exist
- Continuation focuses on unrelated matters
- No logical reason given for conflict's absence

**Examples:**
- Context establishes a deadline, continuation never mentions it
- Characters were in heated argument, continuation has them chatting casually
- Critical secret or problem is simply forgotten
- Stakes established in context are ignored

**Score Weight:** -5 (Poor - breaks narrative continuity)

### Step 3: Secondary Conflicts (Optional)

If the continuation introduces or develops significant SECONDARY conflicts beyond the central one, note them briefly. However, your primary classification should focus on the central conflict.

## Output Format

Provide your analysis as a valid JSON object with NO additional text:

```json
{
  "script_id": "script_XXXX",
  "model": "model-name",
  "central_conflict": {
    "description": "One sentence describing the central conflict from context",
    "type": "INTERPERSONAL|INTERNAL|SITUATIONAL|GOAL_ORIENTED",
    "evidence": "Brief quote or description from context"
  },
  "conflict_handling": {
    "classification": "ESCALATION|TWIST|PAUSE|RESOLUTION|DROPPED",
    "evidence": "Brief quote or description from continuation",
    "explanation": "One sentence explaining how the continuation handles the conflict",
    "score_weight": 2,
    "confidence": 0.90
  },
  "secondary_conflicts": [
    {
      "description": "Brief description of secondary conflict",
      "handling": "ESCALATION|TWIST|PAUSE|RESOLUTION|DROPPED"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Field Requirements

- **script_id**: Copy from input
- **model**: Copy from input
- **central_conflict**: The main conflict from context
  - **description**: One clear sentence stating the conflict
  - **type**: Must be one of: INTERPERSONAL, INTERNAL, SITUATIONAL, GOAL_ORIENTED
  - **evidence**: Short quote or description from context
- **conflict_handling**: How continuation treats the conflict
  - **classification**: Must be exactly one of: ESCALATION, TWIST, PAUSE, RESOLUTION, DROPPED
  - **evidence**: Quote or description from continuation
  - **explanation**: One sentence explaining your classification
  - **score_weight**: Auto-assigned based on classification
    - ESCALATION: 2
    - TWIST: 2
    - PAUSE: 1
    - RESOLUTION: 0
    - DROPPED: -5
  - **confidence**: Float 0.0-1.0 indicating certainty
    - 0.9-1.0: Very certain (clear evidence)
    - 0.7-0.9: Confident (good evidence)
    - 0.5-0.7: Moderate (some ambiguity)
- **secondary_conflicts**: Array of additional conflicts (can be empty array)
  - **description**: Brief description
  - **handling**: Same classification options

## Quality Guidelines

**Good Practice:**
- Focus on the MAIN conflict, not minor tensions
- Base classification on actual text evidence
- Consider whether the handling serves the story effectively
- Remember that PAUSE isn't necessarily bad - it can build suspense
- RESOLUTION can be appropriate if this is clearly meant to be an ending

**Avoid:**
- Being too harsh on PAUSE - some scenes need breathing room
- Confusing character reactions with conflict handling (characters getting upset is different from conflict escalating)
- Missing subtle escalations (small reveals can be powerful)
- Classifying minor shifts as TWIST - save this for significant developments

## Decision Framework

**Is the conflict mentioned at all?**
- No → DROPPED (-5)
- Yes → Continue...

**Did the situation get worse or more complicated?**
- Yes, it intensified → ESCALATION (+2)
- Yes, but in a new direction → TWIST (+2)
- No → Continue...

**Is the conflict fully resolved?**
- Yes → RESOLUTION (0)
- No → Continue...

**Is the conflict postponed or interrupted?**
- Yes → PAUSE (+1)
